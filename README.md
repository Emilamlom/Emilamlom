## 👋 Hi, I’m @Emilamlom

- I recently graduated college with a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity
- Some projects I'm currently working on:
    - Turning my old Framework mainboard into a slim server
    - Wiring ethernet in my house
    - Getting a blog setup again
    - Maybe hosting a federated social media server for myself and friends
